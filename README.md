# Todo App (Coding Challenge)

The app is a simple todo list application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to add, delete, mark as complete and filter tasks.

It was created using `bun init` in bun v1.3.1. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
